# PascalCompiler
The project assignment for INF2100 - Project in programming at University of Oslo (autumn 2016)

The compiler was implemented as a part of project assignment for the course INF2100 - Project in programming during my third semester at the University of Oslo.

The work was splitted into 4 parts: Scanner, Parser, Checker and Code Generator. The compiler works for the .pas files provided in a folder pascalfiles/ . During the assignment the simplified version of Pascal was used.
